# Confidence-and-functions-of-dendrites

Dendrites grow in the brain as a physical or emotional reaction to input from the surroundings of the system. Dendrites are created as an If-then-else instruction set which is then accessed via the brain through the axon. When dendrites are used by the brain to make decisions, and the expected if-then-else id received, a conscious decision is made to depend on those specific dendrite structures which created the expected response.

An over abundance of dendrites created from traumatic decisions create a system which lacks propper if-then-else programming required to make concious decisions. Dendrites which are formed from submitting one's self to a negative situation create a victim-like mindstate in which the brain makes repetitive decisions that place the body in dangerous situations.

Access of dendrites which have a history involving accurate if-then-else responses should be the primary method for escaping negative situations. Ideas in the brain are created in the brain as dendrites which the brain compares againsts existing dendrites created from real situations. These idea dendrites are then given confidence as a response to patterns that match dendrites which have been historically used with positive outcomes.

The brain as a library of axons:
The frontal lobe, motor cortex, sensory cortex, partietel and occipital lobes are sections of a dendrite library which is accessed to produce various functions or interpretations for input from the environment. Confidence in movement, arithmetic, decision making and sensations is created from created from practice which builds if-then-else instruction sets.

Example, Catching a baseball:
A child is learning to catch a baseball.

First Throw
If: Ball Aproaches
Then: Extend arm and glove to ball's expected location
Result: Ball is missed

Second Throw
If: Ball Aproaches close enough to catch
Then: Extend arm and glove to ball's expected location
Else: step foward to ball's location, extending arm and glove to ball's expected location
Result: Ball bounces out of glove and lands on ground

Third Throw
If: Ball Aproaches close enough to catch
Then: Extend arm and glove to ball's location, close glove when ball makes contact with glove
Else: step foward to balls location, extending arm and glove to ball's expected location ready to close glove
Result: Ball is caught, child builds confidence in dendrite instruction set thorugh practice and successfull catching. Father throws ball closer this time, from visually observing his son struggling to reach the ball building confidence in his new instruction set for throwing a baseball to his young child.
