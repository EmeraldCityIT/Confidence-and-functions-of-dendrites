# Confidence-and-functions-of-dendrites
Dendrites grow in the brain as an emotional reaction to input from the surroundings of the system. Dendrites are created as an If-then-else instruction set which is then accessed via the brain through the axon. When dendrites are used by the brain to make decisions, and the expected if-then-else id received, a conscious decision is made to depend on those specific dendrite structures which created the expected response.

An over abundance of dendrites created from traumatic decisions create a system which lacks propper if-then-else programming required to make concious decisions. Dendrites which are formed from submitting one's self to a negative situation create a victim-like mindstate in which the brain makes repetitive decisions that place the body in dangerous situations.

Access of dendrites which have a history involving accurate if-then-else responses should be the primary method for escaping negative situations. Ideas in the brain are created in the brain as dendrites which the brain compares againsts existing dendrites created from real situations. These idea dendrites are then given confidence as a response to patterns that match dendrites which have been historically used with positive outcomes.
